# 🚀 Google Colab

Welcome to **Project Name** — a space where ideas meet Python, all powered by the cloud magic of **Google Colab**.  

This project was built, tested, and run entirely on **Google Colab**, making collaboration seamless and code execution lightning-fast.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Google Colab**  
  Cloud-based Jupyter notebooks for fast prototyping, data exploration, and collaboration.  

- **Python 3.x**  
  The heart of the project. From data wrangling to automation, Python drives everything under the hood.  

- **Libraries & Tools** *(customize this based on what you used)*  
  - `numpy` → numerical computations  
  - `pandas` → data analysis and manipulation  
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn` → visualizations  
  - `scikit-learn` → machine learning models  
  - `tensorflow` / `pytorch` *(if used)* → deep learning
